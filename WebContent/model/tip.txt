                <h5>Masculine and Feminine Nouns</h5>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Spanish all nouns are masculine or feminine.
                    Usually, nouns that end with an "o" are masculine,
                    and nouns that end with an "a" are feminine.
                    For example, "manzana" (apple) is feminine and "diario" (newspaper) is masculine.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The articles "el" and "un" are used with masculine nouns,
                    and the articles "la" and "una" are used with feminine nouns.
                    "The apple" is "la manzana" and "a newspaper" is "un diario."<br>

                <h5>Accent Marks</h5>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vowels in Spanish can have an accent mark, such as the "u" in "men¨²" (menu).
                    One use of the accent mark is to indicate which syllable should be stressed in the pronunciation.
                    For example, in "tel¨¦fono" (telephone), the second "e" has the most stress.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accent marks are also used to distinguish homophones.
                    For example, "¨¦l" and "el" are homophones because they have the same pronunciation.
                    However, "¨¦l" is a masculine pronoun (meaning "he" or "him")
                    and "el" is a masculine article (meaning "the").<br>
